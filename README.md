# SLXmodel

[Vega and Elhorst (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jors.12188) R code. The file `vega_elhorst_rep.R` replicates columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 (p. 18), i.e., the SLX model with a Binary Contiguous W matrix and with a parameterized inverse distance W matrix. This code is based on the original MATLAB files available on Elhorst's website.
